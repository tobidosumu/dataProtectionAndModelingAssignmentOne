          all relevant laws and regulations.

    iii.  Purpose limitation: Personal data must be collected for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes and must not 
          be further processed in a way that is incompatible with those purposes.

     iv.  Data minimization: Personal data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes 
          for which it is processed.

      v.  Accuracy: Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date.

     vi.  Storage limitation: Personal data must be kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer

          take responsibility for ensuring that personal data is processed in a compliant and secure manner.

      ix. Security: Data controllers must implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal 
          data against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

       x. Data subject rights: Data subjects have the right to access, rectify, erase, or restrict the processing of their 
          personal data, as well as the right to data portability and the right to object to the processing of their personal data.

      xi. Data breaches: Data controllers must notify the relevant authorities and data subjects in the event of a personal data breach.

     xii. International data transfers: Personal data must not be transferred to countries or territories outside of Nigeria 
          unless appropriate safeguards are in place.

    xiii. Third-party processors: Data controllers must enter into written agreements with third-party processors to ensure 
          compliance with the NDPR.

     xiv. Appointment of a Data Protection Officer (DPO): Data controllers must appoint a DPO to ensure compliance with the NDPR.


     N.B: Please note that this list may not be exhaustive and that the NDPR may be subject to change.




  IV. Write a user story that follows the principle of Data minimization
  
      As a user, I want to only provide the minimal amount of personal data necessary when creating a new account, 
      so that my privacy is protected.

      When creating a new account, the system should only ask for the essential information needed to set up my account, 
      such as my name, email address, and password. Optional information, such as my address or phone number, should not be required.

      As I interact with the system, I want to be able to control what personal data is shared and for what purpose. 
      This will allow me to make informed decisions about my data and ensure that my privacy is respected.

      In the event that additional information is required for certain features or services, I want to be clearly 
      informed of the reasons for collecting this data and have the option to decline.

      The system should also have measures in place to ensure that any personal data collected is accurate, up to 
      date and deleted or anonymized after it is no longer needed.

      Overall, this user story is in line with the principle of Data Minimization, which is one of the core principles 
      of data protection which states that personal data should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary 
      for the purposes for which it is processed. 
      This helps to ensure that data controllers only collect the minimum amount of personal data necessary to achieve their 
      purposes and that the data is not kept for longer than necessary.
      
      
      

  V. Write 10 differences btw GDPR and Isah Pantami's data protection principles
  
       i. Jurisdiction: GDPR applies to the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) while NDPR applies to Nigeria.

      ii. Enforceability: GDPR is enforceable by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) while NDPR is enforceable by the 
          National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) and other relevant authorities in Nigeria.

     iii. Scope: GDPR applies to any company or organization that processes personal data of EU or EEA residents, 
          regardless of where the company or organization is based, while NDPR applies to companies or organizations 
          that process personal data of Nigerian residents.

      iv. Penalties: GDPR provides for penalties of up to 4% of a company's annual worldwide turnover or â‚¬20 million 
          (whichever is greater) for non-compliance, while NDPR provides for penalties of up to NGN 10 million (approximately $27,000) 
          for non-compliance.

       v. Data subjects' rights: GDPR provides data subjects with a right to be forgotten and a right to data portability 
          while NDPR only provides data subjects with the right to access, rectify, erase or restrict the processing of 
          their personal data

      vi. Data breaches: GDPR requires data controllers to report data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority within 
          72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, while NDPR requires data controllers to notify the relevant authorities and 
          data subjects of data breaches.

     vii. Data protection officer: GDPR requires certain organizations to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) while 
          NDPR only requires certain organizations to appoint a DPO if the organization processes personal data on a large 
          scale or processes sensitive personal data.

    viii. International data transfer: GDPR requires data controllers to obtain specific authorizations for international 
          data transfers while NDPR only requires data controllers to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place before 
          transferring personal data out of Nigeria.

      iv. Definition of personal data: GDPR includes genetic and biometric data as personal data while NDPR does not.

       v. GDPR has a more detailed and prescriptive approach on data protection while NDPR is less prescriptive and leaves 
          more room for flexibility.
